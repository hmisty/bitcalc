## Rationale

### Why another address generator?

Existing cold wallet tools (e.g. bitaddress.org) only support Legacy P2PKH addresses (starting with `1`) and lack Native SegWit (bech32, starting with `bc1`). Furthermore, they only export raw private keys (WIF), not BIP-39 mnemonics.

### Quantum Preparedness (BIP-361)

[BIP-361](https://www.bip361.org/) proposes a phased quantum migration plan. Phase C plans to allow users to recover funds from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs by submitting a **zero-knowledge proof of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase**. This means **mnemonics are the key credential for proving ownership in future quantum migration** — raw private keys alone are insufficient.

Without a mnemonic, you cannot participate in BIP-361's Phase C recovery mechanism. Once a cryptographically-relevant quantum computer matures, addresses that have exposed their public keys on-chain could be stolen.

> *Phase C: Users with frozen quantum vulnerable funds and a HD wallet seed phrase can construct a quantum safe proof to recover funds.* — BIP-361

**BitCalc supports both raw addresses (Legacy + SegWit) and BIP-39 mnemonic paths** — meeting today's needs while preparing for future quantum migration.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Brain Wallet** | Password → SHA256ⁿ → entropy, optional iterations |
| **Random Wallet** | Mouse + keyboard entropy collection → SecureRandom PRNG |
| **Classical Path** | Compressed P2PKH + Native SegWit + uncompressed P2PKH (collapsed, bitaddress.org compatible) |
| **Mnemonic Path** | BIP39 12/24 words → PBKDF2 → BIP32 HD → m/84'/0'/0'/0/0 |
| **Mnemonic Recovery** | Input mnemonic → recover entropy, seed, HD address list |
| **Verify** | Validate mnemonic checksum, WIF private key, address format |
| **Self Test** | 25 built-in test vectors against known values |
| **Password Strength** | Creation mode enforces ≥30 chars + upper/lower/digit/special |
| **Danger Guard** | Advanced options disabled by default, enabled via checkbox |
| **Auto-fill Recovery** | Generated mnemonic auto-filled to recovery tab |
| **Loading Animation** | Spinner overlay during computation |
| **QR Code** | QR codes for addresses and private keys |
| **Bilingual** | Chinese / English UI toggle |
| **Fully Offline** | Single HTML file, open in any browser |

## Changelog

### 2026-06-24

- **Classical path restructured**: Added compressed P2PKH for bitaddress.org compatibility; split compressed/uncompressed into two groups, uncompressed collapsed by default
- **Compressed P2PKH**: New display of compressed public key P2PKH address
- **Password strength**: Creation mode enforces ≥30 chars + upper/lower/digit/special
- **Danger guard**: Iterations and passphrase inputs disabled by default, require checkbox confirmation
- **Default 12 words**: Mnemonic defaults to 12 words (was 24)
- **Auto-fill recovery**: Generated mnemonic auto-fills the recovery tab and clears old results
- **Test vectors**: Added 14 new test vectors (12-word + 9999 iterations), totaling 25 self-tests
- **Loading animation**: All action buttons show a spinner overlay during computation
- **bech32 bug fix**: Fixed `decodeSegwit` operator precedence issue
- **Password field**: `autocomplete="new-password"` prevents browser save-password prompts
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow for automatic build and GitHub Pages deployment

## Usage

### Open & Use

Open `bitcalc.html` directly in a browser — no server needed.

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your>/bitcalc.git
cd bitcalc
npm install
npm run build
```

Output: `bitcalc.html` — a portable single-file HTML.

## Security Notes

- **Use offline only**: Disconnect from the internet before generating wallets. Verify your browser cannot reach any network.
- **Keys are ephemeral**: This tool stores nothing. Refreshing or closing the page will permanently lose the generated keys.
- **Paper backup**: Print and seal your wallet. Never store private keys digitally.
- **Verify integrity**: Check the SHA256 hash of `bitcalc.html` before use.
